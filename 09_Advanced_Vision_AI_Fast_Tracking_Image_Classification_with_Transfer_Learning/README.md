## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the power of transfer learning for rapid and efficient image classification across multiple challenging datasets. I implemented and compared three state-of-the-art pre-trained architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2) on both CIFAR-100 and Oxford Flowers 102 datasets, showcasing how ImageNet-trained models can be effectively adapted for diverse visual classification tasks.
