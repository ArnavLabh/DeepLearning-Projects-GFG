Building production-ready computer vision applications with state-of-the-art object detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. This project demonstrates real-world computer vision implementation from basic image processing to advanced real-time object detection systems.

## Technical Implementation

### 12.1 Object Detection with YOLO

**Core Technologies:**
- **YOLOv8** (Ultralytics) - Latest YOLO architecture for real-time object detection
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision operations and image processing
- **Haar Cascades** - Traditional face and eye detection
- **Google Colab** - Cloud-based development and execution

**Key Features:**
- **Multiple Detection Methods**: Traditional cascades vs. modern deep learning approaches
- **Real-time Processing**: Live camera feed object detection capabilities
- **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side comparison of original vs. detected images
- **Production Pipeline**: End-to-end detection workflow from image input to annotated output

### Implementation Highlights

**1. Traditional Computer Vision (OpenCV Haar Cascades)**
```python
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')
eye_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_eye.xml')
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, 1.2, 1)
```

**2. Modern Deep Learning Approach (YOLOv8)**
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
results = model('https://ultralytics.com/images/zidane.jpg')
annotated_img = results[0].plot()
```

**3. Real-time Object Detection**
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
while cap.isOpened():
    success, frame = cap.read()
    if success:
        results = model(frame)
        annotated_frame = results[0].plot()
        cv2_imshow(annotated_frame)
```
